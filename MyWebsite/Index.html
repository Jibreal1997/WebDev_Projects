              <strong>Abstract:</strong> Abstract
              Monitoring and managing potential infected patients of COVID-19 is still a great challenge for the latest
              technologies. In this work, IoT based wearable monitoring device is designed to measure various vital
              signs related to COVID-19. Moreover, the system automatically alerts the concerned medical authorities
              about any violations of quarantine for potentially infected patients by monitoring their real time GPS
              data. The wearable sensor placed on the body is connected to edge node in IoT cloud where the data is
              processed and analyzed to define the state of health condition. The proposed system is implemented with
              three layered functionalities as wearable IoT sensor layer, cloud layer with Application Peripheral
              Interface (API) and Android web layer for mobile phones. Each layer has individual functionality, first
              the data is measured from IoT sensor layer to define the health symptoms. The next layer is used to store
              the information in the cloud database for preventive measures, alerts, and immediate actions. The Android
              mobile application layer is responsible for providing notifications and alerts for the potentially
              infected patient family respondents. The integrated system has both API and mobile application
              synchronized with each other for predicting and alarming the situation. The design serves as an essential
              platform that defines the measured readings of COVID-19 symptoms for monitoring, management, and analysis.
              Furthermore, the work disseminates how digital remote platform as wearable device can be used as a
              monitoring device to track the health and recovery of a COVID-19 patient.

              <strong>Abstract: </strong>Fire safety has been a major concern for vehicles for a long time. Especially
              vehicles which carry a large number of people e.g.: Trains, Buses, and Ships. Taking this problem into
              consideration, a circuit has been designed that could minimize the adverse effects of such incidents and
              decrease the emergency response time by detecting the fire and finding the nearest helping station based
              on the coordinates using Haver sine formula. The system proposed has multiple uses, when no fire is
              detected the circuit live streams data including temperature, number of passengers, location, and the
              speed of the bus to the monitoring station using an API. When fire is detected by the sensors, the data
              from these sensors is used by the program to autonomously perform series of steps including opening the
              windows and sending the information to the nearest firefighting department in order to decrease the
              response time. Prototype implementation shows that the system is able to detect the fire on time and send
              the information without significant lag to the closest fire station. This paper also provides a simplified
              guide to the researcher who would like to conduct projects based on IOT and fire safety.

              <strong>Abstract: </strong> Acute Bronchiolitis is a disease which usually infects children of the age 0
              to 6 years old. The patients infected by this disease require medical attention at hospitals. The patients
              must be admitted in the hospitals for a period of 2-3 days. Parents of the patients must stay in the
              hospital along with them. This causes lack of hospital beds, more expense of the hospital to provide extra
              food for the parents. By a qualitative research, it was found that parents would want an affordable device
              so that they could care for their children from home instead of staying at the hospital. Parents from all
              over Oman come to the capital so that their children can be treated. Children also tend to get exposed to
              more sickness by being around sick children at the hospital. Taking this problem into consideration, a
              circuit has been designed in such a way it was easy to use and that it could be used by parents to treat
              their children at home without the need to visit a hospital. The circuit works on Arduino Uno and has
              various pre-existing modules attached to it , the estimated cost of the device is far lesser than what the
              mainstream industrial devices cost. The device consists of a Bluetooth Module for the purpose of
              connectivity via cellphone ,a 12V vacuum pump to suck the mucus out of the patient’s lungs, variable
              resistor to control the force of vacuum and a rubber tube capable of fitting into the nostril to allow
              suction of mucus. This simple device made from the counter parts can offer significant benefits to
              patients affected by Acute Bronchitis.

              <strong>Abstract: </strong> The paper is intended to keep up security amongst 4 parallel telephones
              associated with a solitary telephone cable wire. The proposed system provide near independent line like
              performance for the set of 4 intercoms line. At the point when two or more telephone is associated with a
              solitary telephone wire line, anybody can pick up telephone to attend the discussion on other end. The
              projected framework gives an answer for security amongst the telephones associated. So as to meet the
              prerequisite we are utilizing four phones associated as a part of parallel throughout solitary phone cable
              line with every phone associated through communicate a transfer in the framework.

              At the point when any of phone is picked up every single other telephone are disengaged by the transfers
              through a configuration plan of opt couplers, the consequence of that is provided to a code able Arduino.
              The Arduino drives signal to a seven segment demonstration to show which phone is picked up, whereas
              different phones are disengaged by particular transfers with assist of Relay-Driver Integrated Circuit
              connected to Arduino.

              The system can be utilized in home and workplaces there two or more phone is associated in parallel
              throughout a solitary phone line wire. The venture is reasonable for both approaching and going outward
              calls.

              Facilitate the venture can be upgraded by including more numeral of telephones with intercom service. An
              approaching caller ID service can likewise add further to this.

              <strong>Abstract: </strong> LPG and Natural Gas are the two primary gases used in Gas cookers all over the
              world , when these Gases leak in high concentration in enclosed areas the results can be fatal. Keeping
              this situation in mind this paper proposes a solution which prevents the buildup of flammable gases in
              enclosed area by autonomously opening windows through linear actuators. The concentration of flammable gas
              in a room can be detected through the MQ-5 sensor , once the concentration of this gas exceeds the
              predefined threshold MQ-5 sensor sends an output to the Raspberry Pi which takes a series of steps in
              order to prevent the situation from taking a fatal turn. The steps include: Opening the Windows in order
              to prevent the buildup of flammable gas, Alerting the Residents of the house via an E-mail and an indoor
              alarm, Sending the precise location of the house (GPS co-ordinates) to a fire station. All these steps are
              done autonomously in real time , thereby responding to the situation in the most efficient way.
